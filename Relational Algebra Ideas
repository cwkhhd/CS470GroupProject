What teams made it to the knockout round
What were the scores of each team for each of the groups?  Recall that the point awards are loss: 0 tie: 1 win: 2
How many wins, losses, ties did team x get?
How many games ended in a tie?
What was the average score for team x
For all teams what was the highest score?
For all teams what was the lowsest score?

/*Player with most goals */

/*Matches held in given stadium */

/*All teams that played games that ended in a tie*/

/*Players who have played in a match involving a given team*/

/*Average score for team x 
* G avg(Team) (π Team_A as Team (σ (team_A = "x") (Matches)) ∪ π Team_B as Team ((σ (team_B = "x") Matches))

/*For all teams what was the highest score?
Team G max(Score)(π(Team_1 as Team, Score_1 as Score)(Matches) ∪ π(Team_2 as Team, Score_2 as Score)(Matches))

Scores for teams from group x

Team G sum(Team)(((π (Team_A as Team)(σ (Team_A = Winner) Match ⨝ (match_Number = Match_No)(σ(Match_Type = "group x")(Stage_Junction)) ))
∪ (π (Team A as Team)(σ (Winner isNull)(Match ⨝ (match_Number = Match_No)(σ(Match_Type = "group x")(Stage_Junction)))))
∪ (π (Team_B as Team)(σ (Team_B = Winner) Match ⨝ (match_Number = Match_No)(σ(Match_Type = "group x")(Stage_Junction))))
∪ (π (Team B as Team)(σ (Winner isNull)(Match ⨝ (match_Number = Match_No)(σ(Match_Type = "group x")(Stage_Junction))))))

/* Matches won by team A
π(Match Number, Team_1, Team_2, Result, Winner)(σ(Winner='Team A')(MATCH))

/* Team A information
π(Name, Nick_Name, Manager, Captian)(σ(Name='Team A')(TEAM))
